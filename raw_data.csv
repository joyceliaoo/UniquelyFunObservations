"""A Wizard's Hoard""",3648,"P. Mich. inv. 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 600, 601, 602, and 603.",Pap,"Groups I and II were rolled up and very brittle, and were separated and flattened out by Mr. Lamacraft of the British Museum. Group III was found with several blank leaves of the same size and the braided cord with which they were originally bound into a codex.","The handwriting of the papyri in group I (P. Mich. inv. 594, 595, 596, 597, 598, 599, 603) is extremely rude and uneven, as though produced by some nearly illiterate person who seldomhad occasion to write. The pen which he used was stiff and inelastic, and fed the ink badly, as though not properly split. The ink was too thick. The writer blotted letters or words, either by accident or because they did not suit him; and in the latter case he often repeated words standing before the blot. The whole performance suggests a negligent paralytic or a very young child. The letters are drawn, not written with the swing of an ordinary writer. For similar hands, cf. P. Mich. inv. 3565, British Museum MS No. 1224 (Catalogue of the Coptic Manuscripts in the British Museum (1905), Plate XII); a third is published by Crum(Receuil d' Études dédiées a la mémoire de Jean François Champollion (1922), Plate VII).","The handwriting of group II (P. Mich. inv. 600, 601, and 602)  is not entirely unpracticed, though not a book-hand. It varies in size, according to the available space, and tends to sprawl.",unknown,unknown,"February 1921; Acquired by Sir Budge; Notes by Crum, 1921",Coptic,literary, magic,unknown,a collection of magical texts,"Internally, the collection falls in three parts:","A. a magical text, represented by 593, and duplicated by nos. 599, 594, 603, and 596, in the order named;","B.
